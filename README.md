## [Project 1: Smart Irrigation ](https://github.com/ysfelkantri/Smart_irrigation) 

**About** : Collaborating on an edge computing system app related to precision farming field that collects information to monitor plants, intervenes for agricultural management, supervise the irrigation system in real time and automatically guide this process.
*  the system is easy to handle without any special knowledge of computer or electronics.
*  the system is designed in such a way that we can modify it without having to redo all the work.
*  the system can be adapted to other cases and application situations which are part of "smart irrigation".  

The entire system is powered by an electrical system ensuring optimal energy consumption. In his mobile / web application the user will be able to monitor this energy consumption.
The irrigation system is therefore essentially based on:
* The implementation of networks of communicating sensors and actuators,
* The implementation of an on-board Raspberry control / command platform to collect information from sensors and monitor the system remotely.
* The implementation of appropriate software in the embedded systems under a C, Python and Linux environment.
* Client / server communication via remote communication protocols and mobile / web applications.


## [Project 2: food manager website ](https://github.com/ysfelkantri/food_web_site) 

**About** : Collaborating on creating a website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL database and [spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs).
*  The idea behind this web-site is to manage foods combining restaurant meals and cooking at home to help you find and organize restaurant:
      - find recipes to use ingredients you already have ("what's in your fridge" search)
      - find recipes based on nutritional requirements
      - manage your favories list. 
*  We automatically analyze recipes to check for ingredients that contain common allergens, such as wheat, dairy, eggs, soy, nuts, etc. We also determine whether a recipe is vegan, vegetarian, Paleo friendly, Whole30 compliant, and more.
*  We compute the nutritional information for recipes automatically using a proprietary algorithm. With this information, you can find individual recipes or even create entire meal plans that satisfy your users' dietary goals.
   
   
## [Project 3: watering cows controlled system ](https://github.com/ysfelkantri/embedded_soft_project) 

**About** : a prototype of a controlled system to solve the problem related to the watering of dairy cows

Included in the field of precision agriculture, this project aims to produce a prototype of a controlled system capable of automating the watering of dairy cows in buildings, based on the client-server architecture, a fairly interesting whose main assets are:
* The server allows to acquire the values of the water level in the tank periodically.
* The server stores the values collected by the sensors in a database.
* The web interface allows manual control of the pump.
* The web interface allows monitoring of the system status in real time.
* The web interface displays information on daily water consumption.

## [Project 4: Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network CNN ](https://github.com/ysfelkantri/CNN_CIFAR10) 

**About** : The purpose of this project is to look at CNN architecture, and test its performance on the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) Dataset.

a classification approach based on convolutional neural networks , This project is divided into 4 parts: 
*  Loading and displaying cifar-10 dataset 
*  Pre-processing dataset 
*  Building the model 
*  Testing the model

for this we used a model with a specified architecture and we showed the different results obtained in terms of precision and error. The analysis of the results found has shown that the CNN is a very powerful way to classify image since it gives very high accuracy (86%) and low error.

## [Project 5: Movie Recommender Systems (Machine learning project)](https://github.com/ysfelkantri/systeme_de_recommandation_des_films)

**about** : Collaborating for improving a movie recommendation system using artificial intelligence under python

we have improved a system for recommending films. The goal of the system is to provide accurate movie recommendations to users. Typically, basic recommendation systems consider one of the following factors to generate recommendations:

*     user preference (i.e. based on content filtering)
*     the preference of similar users (collaborative filtering, for example). To build a stable and precise environment The recommendation system used in this project is based on element-based collaborative filtering (in this case movies).

## [Project 6: Flappy Man (2D Game)](https://github.com/ysfelkantri/Flappy_Man)

**about** : developing a 2D game using Java Swing Graphical interface and MYSQL database 

##### Game play 

Flappy Man is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the superman, which moves persistently to the right.
The player is tasked with navigating superman through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights.
superman automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the touchscreen.
Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point.
Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay. During the game over screen, the player is awarded a bronze medal if they reached 3rd place,
a silver medal for 2nd place, a gold medal if the 1st place is reache.
