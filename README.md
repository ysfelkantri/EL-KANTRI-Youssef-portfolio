## [Project 1: Smart Irrigation ](https://github.com/ysfelkantri/Smart_irrigation) 

**about** : Collaborating on an edge computing system app related to precision farming field that collects information to monitor plants, intervenes for agricultural management, supervise the irrigation system in real time and automatically guide this process.
*  the system is easy to handle without any special knowledge of computer or electronics.
*  the system is designed in such a way that we can modify it without having to redo all the work.
*  the system can be adapted to other cases and application situations which are part of "smart irrigation".  

The entire system is powered by an electrical system ensuring optimal energy consumption. In his mobile / web application the user will be able to monitor this energy consumption.
The irrigation system is therefore essentially based on:
* The implementation of networks of communicating sensors and actuators,
* The implementation of an on-board Raspberry control / command platform to collect information from sensors and monitor the system remotely.
* The implementation of appropriate software in the embedded systems under a C, Python and Linux environment.
* Client / server communication via remote communication protocols and mobile / web applications.


## [Project 2: food manager website ](https://github.com/ysfelkantri/food_web_site) 

**about** : Collaborating on creating a website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL database and [spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs).
*  The idea behind this web-site is to manage foods combining restaurant meals and cooking at home to help you find and organize restaurant:
      - find recipes to use ingredients you already have ("what's in your fridge" search)
      - find recipes based on nutritional requirements
      - manage your favories list. 
*  We automatically analyze recipes to check for ingredients that contain common allergens, such as wheat, dairy, eggs, soy, nuts, etc. We also determine whether a recipe is vegan, vegetarian, Paleo friendly, Whole30 compliant, and more.
*  We compute the nutritional information for recipes automatically using a proprietary algorithm. With this information, you can find individual recipes or even create entire meal plans that satisfy your users' dietary goals.
