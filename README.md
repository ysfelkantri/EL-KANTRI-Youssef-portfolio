## [Project 1: Smart Irrigation ](https://github.com/ysfelkantri/Smart_irrigation) 

collaborating on an edge computing system app related to precision farming field that collects information to monitor plants, intervenes for agricultural management, supervise the irrigation system in real time and automatically guide this process
   
The entire system is powered by an electrical system ensuring optimal energy consumption. In his mobile / web application the user will be able to monitor this energy consumption.
The irrigation system is therefore essentially based on:
* The implementation of networks of communicating sensors and actuators,
* The implementation of an on-board Raspberry control / command platform to collect information from sensors and monitor the system remotely.
* The implementation of appropriate software in the embedded systems under a C, Python and Linux environment.
* Client / server communication via remote communication protocols and mobile / web applications.


*  the system is easy to handle without any special knowledge of computer or electronics.
*  the system is designed in such a way that we can modify it without having to redo all the work.
*  the system can be adapted to other cases and application situations which are part of "smart irrigation".
